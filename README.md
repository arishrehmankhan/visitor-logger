# Visitor Logger

## About Repo
Contains the code of screening task of FOSSEE Summer Fellowship 2020 - Spoken Tutorial Event Logs and Analytics System - Create a Spoken Tutorial Analytics System for capturing and visualizing log events (https://spoken-tutorial.org/stfellowship2020/analyticssystem/)

## About my project
This project consists of two webpages (exclusive 'admin' pages) - '/homepage' and '/dashboard'.
Each time a user visits '/homepage', the request (log) is saved in the database using a django middleware.
The log which is saved contains data such as :
```
"path_info": "/homepage/",
"browser_info": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/80.0.3987.122 Safari/537.36",
"request_data": "{}",
"method": "GET",
"event_name": "GET /homepage/",
"visited_by": "arish",
"location_city": "Lucknow",
"location_region": "Uttar Pradesh",
"location_country": "India",
"ip_address": "202.41.10.64",
"timestamp": "2020-03-01T22:00:05"
```
The analytics of logs are displayed on '/dashboard' page.
